# Vipps Signup API code example

The API documentation should be sufficient for integrating with the
Vipps Signup API, but we offer these two Python files as a starting point.
It's not meant to be functioning code, but examples of how to get started.

* `signup-api-post-example.py`: Example of how to send Vipps info about a new merchant.
* `signup-api-callback-example.py: `TODO: Example of the partner's server-side handling of the callback from Vipps.
