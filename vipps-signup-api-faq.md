## Frequently Asked Questions for the Signup API

Document version 2.0.0.

### What is my partnerId?

The partnerId is used to identify the partner. Ask your contact in Vipps to
provide you with your partnerId.

### What is my subscriptionPackageId?

The subscriptionPackageId is used to define which price the merchant will have.
Ask your contact in Vipps to provide you with the correct subscriptionPackageIds.

### Will Vipps send the Signup link to the merchant?

The partner has to forward the signup link to the merchant.

### I sent a signup link to a merchant, but has not received any callback. When will I receive the callback?

The callback is sent after the merchant has completed the signup and signed the
agreement _and_ after Vipps has done KYC and completed the registration process.

This usually takes a couple of days, but sometimes it will take longer if
Vipps needs to contact the merchant for more information to complete the
registration.

Please contact the merchant first, and confirm that they have
completed the signup form and signed it.
